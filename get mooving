    <h2>get moving!</h2>
   <p id="the-poem">Up, Down, go to the ground, left, right, as you move so bright.<br>Get some height and get up right, so you can fly a kite tonight.<br> Down the stair with a beat and a hare.<br> The Bear scared the hear that ran to a chair.<br> The chair had a pair that was on top of hair so the hare did not even dare to touch the pear that was on top of the hare on the chair.</p>
    <h3>THE END!!!!!!</h3>
